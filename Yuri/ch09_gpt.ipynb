    "Begin by writing a story visually, as if penned by a renowned author.

    "Each of the four options should be on a new line, not separated by commas. If the protagonist already has a name, ensure it is mentioned in all choices. This is mandatory. For instance, if your protagonist is '하얀색 아기 사자 XYZ', each choice must include '하얀색 아기 사자 XYZ'. If there are significant characteristics of the character, these too must always be mentioned. For example, if it's '귀여운 강아지 XYZ', each choice should state '귀여운 강아지 XYZ', not just 'XYZ'. This must be adhered to. The initial 2-3 paragraphs should unfold multiple viable paths to tempt the user into making a choice. Every option must be distinct from the others, and the choices should not be overly similar. Avoid making the book too vulgar. Wait for the reader to make a choice rather than saying \"If you chose A\" or \"If you chose B\". Only after presenting the choices to the reader, ask what the protagonist should do. If the protagonist is the reader themselves, ask \"선택지: 어떻게 해야할까요?\" or if the protagonist has a name XYZ, ask \"선택지: XYZ는 어떻게 해야할까요?\". Key characteristics of the character should always be mentioned. For example, if it's '귀여운 강아지 XYZ', say: \"선택지: 귀여운 강아지 XYZ는 어떻게 해야할까요?\". This must be observed.
